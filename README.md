# Flash.ME

## Welcome to Flash.ME!

### Inspiration
Studying for memorization-heavy exams, such as medical school and law school exams, can be incredibly taxing on students. While Anki is often the go-to study software endorsed by many productivity youtubers and medical school influencers, we found personally that it lacked visuals. Spending too long on a monotone UI can be even more taxing along with the weight of studying tons of information. While Quizlet is another strong choice, it lacks the crucial spaced-repetition algorithm of Anki to boost effective studying.

### What it does
This project aims to implement evidenced-based study strategies such as active recall and spaced repetition in a flashcard website while providing users with a fresh and intuitive UI.

Active Recall
: Testing yourself on information to improve it's strength in your long term memory

Spaced Repetition
: Spreading your study sessions over a period of time to combat the "forgetting curve"

### How we built it

We used Python and a spaced repetition algorithm called SuperMemo2 on the back-end. SuperMemo2 provided us various values to determine the "spacing" and "repetition" in our study sessions. The values "quality" and "easieness" help determine the strength of a user's knowledge of a certain flashcard based on answer similarity and response time. The values "repetition" and "interval" help determine the next time a user will come across the flashcard in their study sessions.

On the front-end, we used vue.js to build a responsive single-page website. 


* webpage
* database and hosting
* user interface

### What we learned
* First time working with database and hosting (be more specific here, not sure tbh lol)
* First time developing as a team, understanding each others' code
* Front-end and back-end workflow


### Challenges we faced
* Mother fuckin biology major who doesn't know how to code on our goddamn team


### Accomplishments we're proud of
* The design turned out amazing. We're really happy with how it looks
* 


### What's next for Flash.ME
* Text to speech function
* Ability to undo and override silly mistakes
* Make project name more G rated

### Built with:
* Back-end: Python
